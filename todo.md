## Logging

## Technical
- introduce a magic command (such as _test123) to return some mocked search results
- libraries-settings e2e super flaky
- add ids for libraries for easier migration (maybe google plus code or random or encrypted address?)
- replace all ../.. imports with @ imports
## Search
- faster search (w0.3)
  - multiple pages: search length is linear with page length (e.g. 1000 results for Simone de Beauvoir)
  - voebb: landing page 1.6s, first search 2s, concurrent searches .7s, next page .4s
  - voebb-web: 3s session, 3s search one page, 12s search 5 pages (1.2s per additional page)
  - make search return results one request by one?
- add search as query to url (...?q="koppetsch")
- more covers with different API (google books or amazon)
- back to the top button
## Error handling
## Save state
- save all state constantly (search, bookmarks, etc)
