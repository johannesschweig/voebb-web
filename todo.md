# In progress
# TODO
# Needs spec
- nicer login
- landing page to explain voebb-web and why to login
- setup own heroku cors dyno
- setup process to generate account?
- make app mobile usable
- add indication to bookmarks how many bookmarks are available
- auto-login with saved cookie?
- make search return results one request by one
- empty image frame look ugly
- add logging how long a request took
- replace all ../.. imports with @ imports
- fix export bookmarks file (unit test works :D)
- add ids for libraries for easier migration (maybe google plus code or random or encrypted address?)
- change website title and favicon
- introduce proper logging
- introduce a magic command (such as _test123) to return some mocked search results
- faster search for multiple pages - search length is linear with page length (e.g. 1000 results for Simone de Beauvoir)
- e2e tests for checking correct writing to dropbox file
- check if token is correct otherwise clear store
- libraries-settings e2e super flaky
